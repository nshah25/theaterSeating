# theaterSeating

# **Problem**
  Implement a solution to a theater seating program that assigns seats based on specified text input from the user.
  
#  **Running the Solution**
   1. Download the .java files to your local directory and open a terminal to the source folder. 
   2. Run "javac Main" to produce an executable. 
   3. Run "java Main", and the program will then ask you to enter a file path for a .txt file. Enter the **entire** (absolute) file path. For example, if the file was stored on your desktop, you would enter C:/Users/yourName/Desktop/filename.txt
   
# **Output**
  The program will automatically create a output file called "output.txt" and place it in the src directory after running.

# **Assumptions**
  - The theater is 10x20
  - The seats are labeled A - J, reading from left to right
  - Seating indexing starts at A and is assigned from left to right
  - Viewers want the seats closest to the screen first and want to sit sequentially
